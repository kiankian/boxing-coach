## Project Overview

This is a boxing coaching demo that uses computer vision and AI to analyze boxing punches from video. The project demonstrates a viral concept that combines OpenCV for pose detection with Gemini AI for punch analysis and feedback.

## Core Architecture

The project consists of three main components:

1. **box.json**: Contains punch analysis data generated by Gemini AI, including timestamps, punch quality, feedback, and running statistics
2. **box.py**: OpenCV-based video processor that overlays punch statistics and feedback onto boxing video footage
3. **punching.mp4**: Source video file for processing

## Key Components

### Punch Analysis Data Structure
- Each punch includes: timestamp, result (landed), punch type, bag zone, running totals, and coaching feedback
- Statistics track total good/bad punches separately
- Feedback provides specific coaching advice for punch technique

### Video Processing Pipeline
- Uses MediaPipe for pose detection to track player head position
- Processes video at reduced framerate (20 fps sampling) for efficiency
- Overlays real-time statistics and coaching feedback
- Implements color animations (green for good punches, red for bad punches)
- Outputs final processed video with all overlays

## Dependencies

The Python script requires:
- opencv-python (cv2)
- mediapipe
- numpy
- json
- datetime
- textwrap
- time

## File Structure

- `box.json` - Punch analysis data (generated by Gemini AI)
- `box.py` - Main video processing script
- `punching.mp4` - Source video file
- `final.mp4` - Processed output video
- `gemini_analyze.py` - AI analysis script for generating punch data
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - Project documentation and context

## Development Notes

- Video processing uses dual video inputs (one for processing, one for display)
- Pose detection focuses on head tracking for player identification
- Text rendering includes border effects for better visibility
- Animation system provides visual feedback for punch quality (good/bad)
- Current implementation is a proof-of-concept for real-time boxing coaching

## To Start
